# The New Focus

The New Focus is a Chrome extension that allows readers to cut through the clutter of endless news updates and discover what matters, when it matters – to read with a new focus.

We wanted to solve the issue of news being overwhelmed through an extension that provides users with different editions of news to read at different times of the day – 9am, 12pm and 6pm. 

The Chrome extension would be useful to immediately streamline what is relevant for users at certain times of the day. It also allows readers to access news without having to go the news site directly, and solves the issue of getting bombarded by notifications when it comes to news apps.
